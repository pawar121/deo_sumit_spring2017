But it isn\u2019t truly a confit \u2014 you won\u2019t need gallons of fat. It\u2019s more of a slow braise in olive oil scented with thyme and garlic. The chicken grows dense in the cooking, and deeply flavorful. (Have an immersion circulator? Just bag the chicken with a few tablespoons of olive oil, some salt, pepper, peeled garlic and a couple sprigs of thyme, then put it in the bath at 165 degrees for about four hours.)\u00a0Pull the chicken from the oil when it\u2019s done, and allow it to chill uncovered in the refrigerator until you\u2019re ready to crisp it up in a hot pan while the potatoes roast unattended in the oven. For serving alongside, you discipline some parsley with a knife, and mix it with a salty, acidic mustard dressing that complements the bird.","abstract":null,"print_page":0,"blog":[],"source":"du_recipe","multimedia":[{"credit":"Gentl and Hyers for The New York Times.
