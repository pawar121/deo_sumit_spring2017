The filling is a simple mix of peas, cod and smoked haddock, gently poached in milk, thickened with roux and spiked with dry cider. Don't worry if the fish isn't completely cooked when you're putting together the pie; it will finish up in the oven, where it bubbles under a thick layer of mashed potato and grated cheese. The result is tender and luxuriously creamy comfort food.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"du_recipe","multimedia":[{"credit":"Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times","url":"images\/2017\/01\/03\/dining\/04RUBYREX\/04RUBY-1-thumbStandard.jpg","rank":"1","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":[],"type":"image","width":75},{"credit":"Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times","url":"images\/2017\/01\/03\/dining\/04RUBYREX\/04RUBY-1-articleLarge.jpg","rank":"1","height":400,"subtype":"large","legacy":[],"type":"image","width":600}],"headline":{"main":"Ruby Tandoh Just Wants You to Eat What You Love","name":"Cider-Spiked Fish Pie"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2017-01-04T05:00:00+0000","document_type":"recipe","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tejal","rank":1,"lastname":"Rao"}],"original":"Tejal Rao"},"type_of_material":"Recipe","_id":"586c1b6295d0e03926078d0f","word_count":"215","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/cooking.nytimes.com\/recipes\/1018514-farro-with-roasted-squash-feta-and-mint","snippet":"Falling somewhere between a grain bowl and a warm grain salad, this colorful dish is substantial enough to be a meatless main course, or it makes a hearty side dish to simple roasted meat or fish.
