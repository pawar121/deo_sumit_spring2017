Many roads and bridges are in need of repair or expansion. Similar problems exist for public drinking and wastewater systems, dams and levees, airports, railroads and mass transit systems. Politicians generally agree the nation's infrastructure is in need of improvement. Deciding how to pay for it and which projects should take priority is more difficult.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WHY IT MATTERS: Infrastructure","print_headline":"WHY IT MATTERS: Infrastructure"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2016-10-22T08:12:43Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":"Politics","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"580b1f8595d0e022439c49f5","word_count":"610","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2016\/10\/22\/us\/politics\/ap-us-campaign-2016-why-it-matters-iran.html","snippet":"THE ISSUE: Last year's nuclear deal has removed for now the threat of a U.S.-Iranian military confrontation.

The increasing number of graphic photos and videos depicting the deaths of black men, women and children at the hands of police officers has sparked unrest around the nation. The perception that law enforcement officers are rarely, if ever, punished for what some consider unethical behavior, brutality and even criminal acts against black Americans has led to the rise of new social and civil rights movements like Black Lives Matter.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WHY IT MATTERS: Race and Policing","print_headline":"WHY IT MATTERS: Race and Policing"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2016-10-22T06:09:39Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":"Politics","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"580b02ac95d0e022439c49c6","word_count":"645","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2016\/10\/22\/us\/politics\/ap-us-campaign-2016-why-it-matters-refugees.html","snippet":"THE ISSUE : The United States is the proud home of \"the mother of exiles,\" the Statue of Liberty.
