That's nearly one in five Americans. The trustees who oversee Social Security say the program has enough money to pay full benefits until 2034. But at that point, Social Security will collect only enough taxes to pay 79 percent of benefits. Unless Congress acts, millions of people on fixed incomes would get an automatic 21 percent cut in benefits.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WHY IT MATTERS: Social Security","print_headline":"WHY IT MATTERS: Social Security"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2016-10-22T08:18:36Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":null,"section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":"Politics","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","organization":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"580b20e395d0e022439c49f7","word_count":"615","slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/aponline\/2016\/10\/22\/us\/politics\/ap-us-campaign-2016-why-it-matters-wall-street-regulation.html","snippet":"THE ISSUE: The financial crisis that struck in 2008 touched off the worst recession since the 1930s Great Depression, wiping out $11 trillion in U.S. household wealth and leaving about 8 million Americans jobless.
